	Anyone have a good definition of imaginary vs imaginal?
08:32:42 From Peter Limberg to Everyone:
	ChatGPT comes through again: “Imaginary: This term is often used to describe things that exist only in the imagination or mind, lacking physical reality. It refers to something that is not real in the external, concrete sense. For example, a unicorn is often considered imaginary because it doesn't exist in the physical world, even though it can exist in our thoughts, stories, and art.
	
	Imaginal: Corbin's concept of the "imaginal" is more complex and subtle. It refers to a reality that is distinct from both the purely material and the purely mental, a realm that has its own existence and is accessible through certain modes of perception. Corbin suggests that the imaginal is a place of spiritual significance, a realm where archetypes, symbolic forms, and spiritual truths take on a kind of existence that is different from their existence in the physical world or the mental realm. It's a realm where the "soul" and the "spirit" can interact with deeper layers of reality.”
08:36:28 From Cavan Young to Everyone:
	Replying to "ChatGPT comes throug..."
	
	I somehow got the idea that the imaginary is like the phenomenon of imagination where the imaginal is more like the muscle of imagination or the workspace itself.
08:42:58 From Cavan Young to Everyone:
	So you get someone's priorities when you listen to them play music, and you always get someone’s priorities.  It is really wonderful to be able to say, “Oh okay, this person cares more about this, cares less about that.” You get someone’s value system. 
	
	There's no question that with life experience as you experience loss and love and tragedy, you are slightly changed. Which means that any experience that you’ve had has to be somehow revealed in the process of making music. And I think that almost forces you to make yourself vulnerable to whatever is there to be vulnerable to, because that actually is your strength --- YoYo Ma

09:17:04 From Peter Limberg to Everyone:
	I am heading off now. My share for today:
09:17:22 From Peter Limberg to Everyone:
	Philosopher Henry Corbin distinguish between the imaginary and imaginal, the former is mental images, escapist fantasies, a pure imagination unconnected with reality. The latter, what he referred to as “mundus imaginalis,” is a realm distinct from mental and physical ones, an in-between world bridging the subjective and the objective, were daemons are guides, myths are true, and archetypes are alive. 
	
	The imaginal gives access to a world always in front of us, requiring an uncommon way of perception to witness the wisdom it offers, what Corbin calls “the psycho-spiritual senses,” or what Christians call “spiritual sight.” Supposedly, interacting with the imaginal world, has alchemic effects on our “real” one. 
	
	Does the imaginal realm exist? While I do not how to prove such a claim, I've encountered enough mysterious things that whisper its truth.
09:17:54 From Peter Limberg to Everyone:
	Cavan will lead us to the end. Thanks Cavan. See you everyone. 🙏

09:29:31 From John Mark Padillo to Everyone:
	I am not awake, 	But I am so alive.	The daemon speaks to me at night,	It doesn’t allow me to sleep.	I ask it to quiet down,	“I know you’re excited,	It’s been a while since you felt this way.	But I won’t be able to function,	If you keep chatting with me all night.”		You have so many ideas,	So many dreams,	So many desires to be seen.	You are one crazy mother fucker.	Yeah, you.	And I’m open to listening to you,	I’m willing to let go of the beliefs that caged you, 	Or more effectively,	Put duct tape on your mouth.		What happens next,	What will happen next?	Why not allow the dream to be alive,	Run up the hill at night,	Scream, a feral scream, 	Scream whatever freedom means.	To You.
09:29:43 From Laure X Cast to Everyone:
	There's a lot of freedom in working in purpose when you can see the changes you're working towards are unlikely in your own lifetime. There's something that feels more aligned to me about the powerlessness of ceding any hope of living in a utopia, of knowing there's not even a way to experience what your actions might be laying the groundwork for.
09:29:50 From Kevin DeLand to Everyone:
	Deep Work requires setting up a container around yourself where nothing can get through. Your body and your mind in complete alignment with whatever you are working on. Total teamwork. The object of your focus is prioritized above all else, an extension of your self.
	
	Some things I will commit to Deep Work on within the next week.
	- Learning to do a 180º spin on a balance board.
	- Memorizing Gene Keys & their I-Ching symbols, what they mean, and how they are interconnected.
	- Writing code for augmented reality math art to post on TikTok.
	- Writing and publishing posts on Substack about my personal journey and philosophy.
09:29:53 From Kevin DeLand to Everyone:
	Replying to "Deep Work requires s..."
	
	When I set up a Deep Work container for each of these, I must answer the question: “What are the relevant things I should include or not include?” It is easier for some than for others (executing a 180º spin is simpler than articulating my personal philosophy).
	
	There is also the question of: “How are these interconnecteed?” and “How do I prioritize them?” For now, journaling seems to be the best tool.

09:31:33 From Melanie Rieback to Everyone:
	Aristotle in Greece called usury “the most unnatural and unjust of all trades.” He said:  “Money is to be used for exchange, not the breeding of money from money."  In Rome, Cicero, Cato and Seneca made similar statements.  This leads us to interesting questions: how do you define the “breeding money from money”?  A large part of our economy and business practices revolve around it.  Is usury just interest bearing loans or does it include leveraging our possessions to make money, as with AirBNB?  What is the difference between Jesus's proverbial money lender and a landlord or a banker or a fund manager?  Can we find ways to separate these occupations from financial extraction?
