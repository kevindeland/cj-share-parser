09:28:22 From Ola O to Everyone:
	Thanks Keith
09:28:23 From Peter Limberg to Everyone:
	Sociologist Charles Derber used the term “conversational narcissist” in his book The Pursuit of Attention. In a conversation, he differentiates between the “support-response” and the “shift-response.” The former keeps the attention on the person who just spoke; the latter shifts attention to the person who is currently speaking. An example:
	
	Peter: I am going to Dublin soon.
	Marcus: Why are you going there? (support-response)
	
	Peter: I am going to Dublin soon.
	Marcus: I was there a few years ago. I had such a good time. (shift-response)
	
	A healthy conversation has the following response configuration: the shift-response dominates when a person has something truly bothersome to discuss and their interlocutor has the capacity to support them. The other situation is when something is quite alive for one person, usually something rare and important, like a marriage. When these conditions are not met for either party, each person uses a mix of responses to find what is alive in the middle.
09:28:26 From Ola O to Everyone:
	Down unexpected paths - from navigating tricky power dynamics and pondering technology's impact on humanity, to cyborg anthropology, to newfound creativity and surfacing long-overdue conflict with my mum. I've developed new skills and ways of being that once felt foreign through these reality tunnels. Though I struggle to fully express the profundity of this growth, I can only keep moving forward mindfully with what's in front of me.
09:28:33 From Laure X Cast to Everyone:
	There's an industry of people teaching techniques of healing and meditation and finding one's calm or productivity or whatever without the central theme of accountability to both oneself and others, and the land and all beings. Naturally that leads to inaction, or at least, only action that supports a dominant paradigm and a system of dominance, only 'feeling good' or 'accomplishing' without regard for one's impact on others. Without being IN relation in the practice of taking responsibility, even the most ardent activists end up reinforcing everything they stand against.
09:28:44 From Jote Lamar to Everyone:
	How did we lose the understanding that human nature is curiosity, awe and generosity?
09:28:51 From John Mark Padillo to Everyone:
	So, hello, I’m John. I’ve been sharing some stuff on this platform for nearly a year now. If my work could be summed up in one word, it would be about Soul-making.
09:29:08 From Kevin DeLand to Everyone:
	Slowing Down.
	I have accomplished plenty in the past month. Another shedding of the feeling of obligation. The front yard is slowly sinking into the lake, and there’s a freaking baby on the way.
	
	What’s the point?
	What’s the point?
	What’s the point?
	
	I wouldn’t be a philosopher if I wasn’t intermittently haunted by this question.
	
	I think I need more negative visualization. More sticks hitting me into the right direction.
	What will my future look like without the freedom I currently have? How much longer can it last?
09:29:42 From Keith Riggs to Everyone:
	The need to feel the spoken words as resonating in my body before I can truly be in experiencing them as they are being and doing in the world is important to me.  Otherwise I am ignorant or absent from seeing them really

09:30:28 From Melanie Rieback to Everyone:
	As technical people, scientists, or business people, we are used to getting free incubation.  But what about the creative artists?   Where are the incubation services for them?  If there are any incubation services at all for creative artists, they tend to not be subsidized at all by the government, which means that the full costs of the program are falling squarely onto those same creative artists, who are the least likely people to be able to afford such a program.   It makes no sense.

	Replying to "How did we lose the ..."
	
	Good question
09:31:09 From Melanie Rieback to Everyone:
	Replying to "As technical people,..."
	
	We’ve got two sets of people, the creatives and the artists, on two different sides of a chasm, looking at each other across the chasm suspiciously.  The artists are glaring at the business people, saying, “those people in suits just ruining the world.”  And the rationalists on the other side are glaring at the creative artists saying, “they're just lazy and want to live off of subsidy doing their hobbies all day.”  We need to take these two groups of people and bring them together.  We need to break through the silos.  And when you bring diverse groups of people together, magic happens.

	Writing about these things is such a gift.
09:31:24 From Peter Limberg to Everyone:

	Similar to the critique of CBT (Stoicism used as a tool): patch up your social anxiety, and head back out to be a productive worker.

	if I make a snarky comment about Peter having imaginary conversations with Marcus Aurelius, is that a “shift-response” or a “support-response” ?
