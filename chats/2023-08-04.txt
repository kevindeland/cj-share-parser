	I know people who fit this description who I wouldn‚Äôt call sociopaths, just have broken attachment systems, but I get where you are going with it. Feels like maybe there needs to be a pairing with ‚Äòseeks power over‚Äô
09:11:56 From ron walkow to Everyone:
	Replying to "@Laure, Arielle, eve..."
	
	I missed any earlier context for this, but one note is that I am struck by the irony that some sociopaths‚Äîor at least hardcore narcissists‚Äîoften make significant positive  contributions to society (even if not with good motives) while some of an empathetic nature have lost their power to do so.
09:16:25 From Peter Limberg to Everyone:
	Replying to "@Laure, Arielle, eve..."
	
	@Laure, I think the key word in the definition is ‚Äúprimary,‚Äù aka in all relational contexts. I will be arguing that there is a ‚Äútrickle-down sociopathy,‚Äù and we all engage in sociopathic behaviour to be effective in our current system, but sociopaths are ‚Äúon‚Äù at all times.
09:16:46 From ron walkow to Everyone:
	Replying to "@Laure, Arielle, eve..."
	
	In part prob a matter of semantics, but this points to one reason the work narcissistic is over used and in too many contexts (what is that great term you use, peter, for a word that has taken on too many understandings/meanings?).  The person with broken attachment who has developed patterns we can call ‚Äúnarcissistic‚Äù can look like someone who actually has a more core narcissistic style.
09:17:08 From ron walkow to Everyone:

	write a poem on sociopaths?
09:17:33 From Peter Limberg to Everyone:
	Replying to "@Laure, Arielle, eve..."
	
	@ron walkow there is the term ‚Äúbenevolent sociopaths,‚Äù and perhaps there needs to be a term to describe, ‚Äúbeneficial sociopaths‚Äù
09:18:07 From Peter Limberg to Everyone:

	Mongrel concept
09:18:47 From ron walkow to Everyone:

	ah right, great concept!
09:21:55 From ron walkow to Everyone:
	Replying to "@Laure, Arielle, eve..."
	
	And an entire interesting discussion around this could be had on the currently wide phenomenon of the narcissist and even sociopathic individual with a  ‚Äúcompassionate/empathetic‚Äù persona.
09:22:43 From Laure X Cast to Everyone:
	Replying to "@Laure, Arielle, eve..."
	
	Even ‚Äòprimary‚Äô isn‚Äôt enough IMO but- do you agree the dominance factor I think is important?

	sorry that came out without grammar

	Would you place ‚Äútrickle down sociopathy‚Äù in the multi-polar trap idea?

	The Cyborg Man has gone to a land beyond language and come back again, with anchors on his elbows and wrists. He‚Äôs now living in 99-dimensional space.
	A vertical phone screen is divided horizontally in two segments:
	On top, a masked man with geometric superpowers. Flames shoot from his hands. Yellow magnetic tracers trail his arms as his body moves in smooth but robotic movements. The bottom reveals the code behind the matrix. A green line bounces up and down. A mesh graph of vertices flickering on and off. A series of gears rotates in harmony with his movements.
	
	He is from the future because he does not yet exist, except in his own mind. He must be birthed through this mind and into its fingers, its body, its technological appendages.
09:29:43 From Ola O to Everyone:
	Don a status, disguise to roam incognito? Other times, publicly torch on status to reveal true priorities? I sense both are beautiful when done artistically, privately/publicly, and less foolishly.
09:29:47 From John Mark Padillo to Everyone:
	Suns rise, suns set. 	We change. We grow. We are never the same.	We change and we grow so that one day we may soar‚Ä¶	I left you with those words, on an unforgettable June morn.	You, my love, were a flower that didn‚Äôt need the sun to bloom.	You, ma ch√©ri√©, were a heart that never skipped a beat in loving mine.	We weren‚Äôt ready for one another. Oh, how familiar those words are in our culture‚Ä¶	But what we were, was everything that I needed to have faith,	That the things that don‚Äôt last in time, will always last beyond it.	The mystics call it eternity,	I call it your love.
09:29:47 From Peter Limberg to Everyone:
	I will use the term here to describe a person whose primary relational approach is to use others for personal gain. The modus operandi of sociopaths is ‚Äúhook, then squeeze.‚Äù Hooking, a form of limbic warfare, puts fear in another‚Äôs body. It creates emotional dysregulation, disorienting them by eliciting one of the four trauma responses: fight, flight, freeze, and fawn. 
	
	Once a person‚Äôs disoriented, the hook is in, and they are more easily manipulated. If the person is unhookable, the sociopath will leverage their social power to ‚Äúsqueeze‚Äù them, putting external pressure on their resources or relationships.  If the sociopath has no social power to do this, they will leave if they cannot hook a person.

09:30:03 From Laure X Cast to Everyone:
	I want to live in purpose, does that determine my identity? I think it's more like 'my identity informs the way I serve the purpose.' This includes any inherent identity (which as I do more work feels like whatever can not be languaged anyway, like 'life essence') and my shapings. Maybe that's not entirely it- there are aspects of me that are consistent and elemental, like my curiosity, but other forms of classification (including gender) feel like they are conveniences for inter-relating rather than essence. I can have fun with the performance of these, but any attachment will prove painful. Is age an identity?

	It is not until it tangles for whatever reason, then it‚Äôs interesting - but also your identity (I believe) is culturally ‚Äúunmakred‚Äù so it likely is more a blind spot
