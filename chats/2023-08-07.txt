	My Papa almost certainly speaks to me through the spirit of the Paw Paw plant. 
	
	Podophyllum peltatum, one of my favorite Latin names to say, as I hiked with my professor up the Pine Mountain Trail. Not only was the alliteration of its name adorable, the plant itself is so precious with its umbrella-like leaves, I squeal nearly every time I see one. For our Plant Taxonomy class, field trips were a regular part occurence. We went to the sand hills, local parks, walking trails, educational outdoor facilities… anywhere there were plants to identify. Waving a stick before her to catch an spider webs, that she also used to point at plants for pop quizzes, our professor introduced us to many different species and families. Becoming acquainted with the forests and gardens this way brought the place to life.
09:27:53 From Peter Limberg to Everyone:
	You’ll find the most terrible examples of gaslighting in cults, where men will use their asymmetry in spiritual capacities to cast doubt on their follower's intuition. The cult leader usually has some form of nonduality, and perhaps is even “awakened,” and sees this spiritual asymmetry as entitlement to tell others how to live. They see their awakened state as akin to wisdom, as do their followers. This shared belief is a lie; awakening and wisdom are not synonymous. 
	
	A man gaslighting a woman in a heterosexual relationship is the most frequent manifestation of this phenomenon. From my experience dealing with these men, they usually have a slew of past girlfriends who are “crazy,” when in reality, they are the ones who make them feel crazy by systemically sowing doubt in their intuition, as well as the wisdom that comes from their emotions. They cast this doubt because they believe they have “superior” reasoning capacities, which they believe provide them with greater contact with reality.

	I was looking through my old website (https://delandbeforeti.me/) and reflecting on my old writing style + ideas.
	Here’s a passage from 2019-05-07-online-identity.md
	
	~*~*~*~
	It's important to me that I maintain as much control as possible over the creation of my own website. I have intentionally avoided using websites like Wix or SquareSpace to build my website, despite the disadvantage this creates in that my site won't necessarily *look* as good as a professionally designed website. This customizability will allow me to create new interactions that those website-creation sites don't afford. The goal for me is to maintain a strong balance between customizability and aesthetic. As my ability grows stronger in each area (programming and designing), etc etc.
	
	### Identity
	Anyways... the big idea of why I want my website to be customizable, is that I am fascinated with how we form our identities online.

	How do you begin?
	
	For Jessica and I, it's the responsibility (duty? honor?) of the first to wake partner to start the coffee for the still sleeping partner. 
	
	If I'm the one making the coffee, I get to open the cupboard, asses the different texts and logos in front of me, and decide which vessel is calling to me on this specific day. If it's Jessica's turn, she has a hand in what that calling might be. It might be my brown, bear-silhouetted keepsake from Yosemite National Park, a wave crested diner mug from our honeymoon to Hawaii, or a souvenir from Indiana's best-named druggist.

	The House of False-Friendship
	Sinew and excrement flooded the floors with a sticky film. The walls were vined with ancient hieroglyphics. "How dare you exist?! Do you DARE to be experienced!? DO YOU LOVE YOUR SELF!" They mocked the space with nausea. Vomit rose to the surface of the ceiling. Cobwebs from a wolf-spider named Raven sat upon the corners of the rafters. The staunch aroma of crustaceans filled the air. "Would you like to try?" the spider opened its mouth to reveal a wolf inside. A red lobster lay upon the altar, claws cracked open prepared as sacrifice, and beside it a bowl of mysterious spices and oil from an unknown land. In the back of the room lay the oldest friend, deriving despair from a "meaningless" existence. I partook a morsel(f) of the offering and left shortly after. I do not. This seems probable of becoming evil. Next. I spent my night somewhere less foolish.

09:30:48 From Melanie Rieback to Everyone:
	NGOs fall into the “subsidy trap”, which is similar to the poverty trap.  You have poor people on state welfare, who want  improve their lives by finding a job or starting a business.  But the moment they take action to do this, they lose their welfare.  So they are caught between a rock and a hard place with the system is holding them in place.
	
	NGOs and nonprofits have the same struggle.  Their income stream consists of subsidies and donations.  But the problem is that if an NGO starts “acting too much like a business”, the tax authorities can evoke an NGOs charitable status.  This a life and death situation for most NGOs, because the moment they lose their charitable status, then donations are no longer tax deductible, which would cause them to lose much of their income.  So they are caught between a rock and a hard place, wanting to leveraging business to ensure sustainable funding streams vs. remaining dependent upon (and vulnerable) upon external donations and subsidies forever.
