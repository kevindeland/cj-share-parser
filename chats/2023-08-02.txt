09:27:29 From Peter Limberg to Everyone:
	Jamie Wheal has a “cult checklist” to spot cults, which includes a leader who creates a mythologized story around themselves, often with a self-appointed name change and some claim of absolute spiritual attainment. This leader usually has “spiritual capacities,” having arrived at some form of nonduality, with the ability to invoke non-ordinary states of consciousness in others. In the prototypical cases of cults, the leaders are highly charismatic and have the “antisocial personality disorder” within the Cluster B grouping, aka psychopaths.
09:27:35 From Peter Limberg to Everyone:
	In cult states, adherence to the leader naturally emerges, oftentimes because the members want to be told what to do. Cults form from cult states not solely from the “counterdependent” temperament of the leader but from the “co-dependent” temperament of the members. The former has a non-attached disposition, while the former has an attached neediness. The symbiotic relationship between the two becomes terrible when there is insufficient power literacy among the members.

	The boundary is ONE.
	
	One can start anywhere. But wherever it starts there is an echo and a therefore a KEY. And then there are all the harmonics that can impose their commentary on the KEY

	- Put on our Software Engineer hat and look through the (new and updated) MediaPipe docs.
	- Admire the colored manuscript from monk Rabanus Maurus, take screenshots.
	- Listen to the “How to Take Over the World” podcast episodes on Da Vinci, perhaps Arnold Schwarzenegger.
	- Look through our yellow notebook and take photos of the most beautiful pages.

	Letting go of preconceived notions, I open myself to new possibilities and allow life to reveal itself one moment at a time, indra net-ically.
09:27:57 From John Mark Padillo to Everyone:
	Sometimes it would come before. Sometimes after. Heck, it came during it too, and all other combinations among the three. It was what I thought to be a bodily vibration, coming from my knees, my arms, my teeth, and my torso and back. I couldn’t control it. It was happening involuntarily. Before/during/after I spoke from a place of vulnerability, a wave of vibrations would rush along my body and seemingly every part of me would shudder. Something was happening then, but I didn’t really know what it was.	These episodes would occur in many safe containers of dialogue that I participated in during the pandemic and was prominently a phenomenon that happened in my Collective Presencing (CP) practice. CP is a practice that encourages one to speak from both a place of aliveness and of unknowingness. In that state, something magical happens, and one begins to speak from Source, a way of channeling and presencing one’s deepest knowings within their embodied contextualized existence.
09:27:57 From Laure X Cast to Everyone:
	A community of practice is a doing not a framework. The container, the structure, is everything, and yet it is empty and meaningless without something emerging within it that is not predictable or standard. As I say that, though, I realize it is predictable, there will be growth, insight, slow transformation, love, and a surprising sense of collective connection, even when people participating don't talk to people outside the container. There’s a path to more depth, more layers of connection, through new kinds of structures. Not new, just combined in new ways.
09:28:27 From Melanie Rieback to Everyone:
	Larry Page and Sergey Brin, started the company as grad students at Stanford, with great intentions.  They wanted to organize the world's information using their backrub algorithm.  And Google started with the slogan “don't be evil”.  At a certain point, they accepted venture capital.  A bit later, the CEO Larry Page got replaced by Eric Schmidt.  A bit later, Google purchased DoubleClick.  And shortly after, the “Don't Be Evil” mysteriously disappeared.   Looking at Google now, of course they're successful, they are one of the largest companies on the planet.  But are they really unequivocally successful?  Has Google ushered in the world that we want to live in?  I can imagine that in retrospect, Larry and Sergey, might have done a few things differently.  But they had accepted venture capital, and lost control over the direction of their company.  Imagine what Google might have been became had it remained also more autonomous.

	I was looking through some docs of a Google ML library that I’ve been using for a project (https://developers.google.com/mediapipe), and have become slightly annoyed that they’ve changed. Feels like that comes part and parcel with internet tech, things change so fast.
