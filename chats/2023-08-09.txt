	At a certain juncture, I lived a cynical and nihilistically colourless life, having lost all hope and meaning. It was a blessing to meet people who helped me to begin to reconnect with the Anima Mundi – the soul of the world.		So, I write and express in stories, poems, and other stuff. My writing is a single a view of a single droplet, falling from a leaf, soon to land and cascade down a rustic rock, and into the Great River of Life.
09:28:50 From Kevin DeLand to Everyone:
	slow morning for me, nothing shareable
09:28:56 From Peter Limberg to Everyone:
	In Tiqqun’s “Theses on the Terrible Community,” there was a fleeting remark, mention almost as an aside, about all the communities that are not terrible: 
	
	“All the other communities are imaginary, not truly impossible, but possible only in moments, and in any case never in the fullness of their actualization. They emerge in struggles, and so they are heterotopias, opacity zones free of any cartography, perpetually in a state of construction and perpetually moving towards disappearance.”
	
	That last sentence resonated: “perpetually in a state of construction and perpetually moving towards disappearance.” The Stoa felt like it was always ending and always just getting started. What on the surface may have seemed like my fickleness, was due to a certain promise to myself I made: when “stewarding” The Stoa I would only follow a certain spirit, going where ever it takes me. And it usually took me to the end, only to beginning again.
09:29:06 From Katy Kelly to Everyone:
	It's just so good to be back here again <3
09:29:25 From Laure X Cast to Everyone:
	Those of us who feel a sense of 'called to lead' are particularly susceptible to the blind spots that come when we feel ourselves "setting an example." Moving beyond isn't policing ourselves or others, and it's also not making excuses or justifying. We are easily led into power games, such as managing or serving. If we look in ourselves for patterns of dominance, we  may notice where fear shows up to warp our thinking and ways of being. The fear that there isn't enough time, the fear that we won't be loved, the fear of non-belonging, the fear of uncertainty. Leading leads to a false idea of a knowable future, because we're promising something to the ones who will follow.

	One evening last week, we got into it. It had to do with my responsibilities towards our construction project that I was being petulant and resentful about. There's A LOT of tile that needs tiling, and I'm the tile guy. It ended up in a bit of breakdown in our love and communication with each other. We went to bed without resolving the issue (I know, I know, never go to bed angry...), and in my small act of passive aggression, I neglected my duty of measuring and grinding the coffee for the morning brew.

	As Edgar Allen Poe might have predicted, my tell-tale heart wouldn't let me sleep later than her. I awoke around 5:15am and decided that my bed was far too comfortable and my perspective in our disagreement was far too correct to bother with getting up and fulfilling my duty. Facing away from her, after a few minutes, I felt her get up and out of bed. We didn't greet each other like usual, and I didn't make the first move like I could have. But instead of getting all the way up, she just used the bathroom then returned to bed. In that moment, I was given another chance.

	I got up, made my way to the kitchen, and remembered why we even made this commitment to each other. We forget that commitments are forged in the anticipation of challenges to them. Odysseus didn't tie himself to the mast as they were approaching calm waters and safe harbor. That's the difference between a relationship of convenience and one of covenant. 
	
	Now, this move to grind the beans didn't soften me completely, but it felt "right" to fulfill my commitment in this way. It's not quite "fake it 'till you make it", but it's a behavioral "vote" for an identity of one who loves. We spent the rest of the morning taking steps back and forth to return to the state we both longed for... peace.
09:30:44 From Melanie Rieback to Everyone:
	One common failure scenario for startups is when aspiring founders go to a pitch competition.   They form groups that pitch on a theme, and they will rush to come up with something for the judges.  If they win the pitch competition, they get some prize money to create the startup.  And then that's the idea behind their startup.   But does this really fit the founders?   Or does it just reflect the interests of the judges?  The problem here is that, if the startup is not something deeply, intensely personal, then when the going gets tough (as it inevitably does), founders will quit.  It takes a lot of persistence to see businesses through.  So this is one reason why entrepreneurs need to “unblock”.  We need listen to the undercurrents in our subconscious, that tell us why we’re here and what we need to be doing.
