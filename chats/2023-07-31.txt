	Most people chose comfort and “retiring”…. So true.  It’s easy to let go and wait for something to catch your fall. As agency is removed you have to stay inventive and diligent.

	I was a ski instructor for 11 years in California and still love to ski tour:  the quote from my earlier self,  “it is hard to leap while falling, but that is what experts do to stay in their flow,” to be fully in their lives.  
	I sense and I have seen that quality of curiosity and courage in my older mentors.

	**Chaotic conversations with, through and as Artemise**		Good and bad news, he was funny.. oh oh.. things are emerging that artemise has helped me avoid for years… parts of me are arising that other parts of me dislike…. Dumb teenagey parts..also Shadowy parts… the part of me that wants 100% of a guy’s attention, and if i sense the minimal distraction i want to vanish…yuck havent felt this in a while… also insecure paranoid parts… i want to run away, should I summon Artemise? This parts feel unsatiable and uncontrolable.. i hate them (artemise speaking) dont know what they want or why they are so powerfull still… is it even possible for them to chill a little? They take me out of my sense of presence and hijack my mind. Its maybe also an opportuniy to get to know them a little. Do I even have a choice?  Dont like feeling vulerable, says Artemise. Dont like being perceived, or wanting to be perceived. Dont like anyone looking at my mess.. my mess is private its mine.
09:28:38 From Laure X Cast to Everyone:
	Communities often work by creating some kinds of shame-enforced rules, whereas communities of practice work by being structured in ways that remove the need for shame, in fact actively resist shame. You can do your work within these spaces because it's clear that the only shame you're contending with is within you, even if the shame in you is a result of other systems. In a community of practice, what keeps you 'in' is simply a commitment to your own practice, and for that reason, members have very different ways of practicing, or even levels of holding themselves accountable to practice. These spaces often have people who just come to be there without actually doing many of the practices. This is fine. It turns out that there's an osmotic aspect to these groups, because even just listening to others practice is a kind of practice, it's a window into freedom.
09:28:45 From Peter Limberg to Everyone:
	Many people trying to make money online tag the word community onto whatever their hustle is. They use the word, invoking a sense of community. The word feels so nice to hear. If it had a smell, it would smell like flowers. If it had a taste, it would taste like homemade butter tarts. If it had a personality, it would be Belle blissfully dancing at the beginning of Beauty and the Beast. People instrumentalize the word, creating a felt-sense verisimilitude of community. That’s all, and that is not a community.
	
	The corporate world is particularly guilty of instrumentalizing the word, and when they do, Corporate Memphis images of generic, productive, and docile people together come to mind.
	
	
	When I see these uninspired images, a phrase comes to mind: terrible community.
09:28:46 From jote lamar to Everyone:
	The closer I get to the intricacy of death, the more I realize the sincerity of the Mother. She is dedicated to fulfilling the cycle. She is dedicated to our full liberation.
	
	I think this is one of the reasons that maggots are so unnerving. Their squirming touches something deep down, a knowing that we will not be left behind. A reminder that the Mother takes all. Our discarded skins and guts and bones will be transformed. Our consciousness will not have the option to linger in our flesh forever. By the grace of maggots, earthworms, vultures, mites, coyote and an uncountable, invisible motley crew, She is taking life by giving it.
09:29:29 From Kevin DeLand to Everyone:
	I wish I had more time to work with these ideas. If I had started 30 minutes earlier instead of dealing with breakfast, I may have finished that super intriguing story that integrated every single quote and sign in the chat this morning. It feels like I just missed the bus.
	
	Anyways… Why did they ever leave this village? It’s so beautiful. The expansive mountain views. The traditions.
	
	Oh yeah. Because only a couple thousand people live here and everybody knows everybody’s business. You can’t even go for a walk through town without someone asking what you’re doing. You have to be going somewhere, doing an errand.
	
	Better to leave for America, for adventures in individuality.
