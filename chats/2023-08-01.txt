08:41:17 From Keith Riggs to Everyone:
	I wrote this morning to our facilitation group of core-practitioners about how some space taking elders need to be quieter so there is time for younger practitioners to let flow through them what is emergent and opens our practice.
	
	As usual there is the good chance that my perception about misuse of power by those who have long been in positions of responsibility is a projection.  When does an organisation need to be turned over in order to find new possibilities? Is a sensing of a group pattern or habitat prejudge that is my projection and perhaps only 10% true worthwhile to bring to the collective attention? How does the emotional activity of the bringer and the group need to be regulated before opening to the larger group?  How does one do this conscious digestion on a full stomach when everyone is busy?

	Cool inverse. My sense is “benevolence of structure,” is the right term, as Jo Freeman’s paper argue, no group can exist without structure: https://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm

	🙂
09:27:58 From Peter Limberg to Everyone:
	Whatever happened is that structure formed in an unacknowledged way, hence unaccountable for, with a secret elite emerging that denies its own existence. As Freeman describes the nature of such elites, the “most insidious elites are usually run by people not known to the larger public at all. Intelligent elitists are usually smart enough not to allow themselves to become well known.” 
	
	The people who operate best in the shadows usually have sociopathic tendencies, lack empathy, and are good at manipulating people who do. They weaponize the word community when a sense of community first emerges, preying on the “community hunger” many have, only to grab power and impose their agenda in the shadows.
09:28:08 From Laure X Cast to Everyone:
	I don't need to pose questions about my willingness to be in my full expression or whatever it may be, I only need to shift into curiosity and purpose. Any kind of prevarication or feeling of misalignment clears up when I am not operating in fear or judgement. The job I have is to notice when I am getting into a state that doesn't feel aligned with stewardship and collaboration with source. Whenever I start thinking about how I will be or am being perceived, whenever I feel anxiety about time, whenever I feel judgement of myself or others, I have drifted from the path, I have left point. It will happen, and there's nothing wrong with it, and my job is to notice, to return to my body, and to realign with curiosity and purpose. There's no good or bad here, only a sense of connection. I don't believe that operating from source 'makes me good' or even that it is ethical, precisely. Truth, at least in the language I have, doesn't survive any naming, and in that sense is pre-moral.
09:28:20 From jote lamar to Everyone:
	The place where sensation and imagination meet Spirit- a vast and highly colonized landscape. Part of it’s vastness lies in the question- where does sensation end and imagination begin? Colonialism puts a rigid frame on what is ‘real’ which, intentionally, over the course of generations, limits our ability to trust or make sense of our senses. When we can’t trust or make sense of our own senses and human centric violence prevails, it seems prudent to focus on surviving that. Tunnel vision. Human Violence. Trauma Spiral. Loss of Sensation. Limited Connection. Many of us got cut off from our animal, plant and elemental guides by surviving colonialism.

	Current lyrics almost done up till first chorus:
09:28:41 From Benjamin Dasher to Everyone:
	Verse One
	As if life wasn’t 
	Hard enough 
	already
	You gotta stay steady 
	as she goes
	And hope that 
	All roads lead to Rome
	
	Two
	The end of days
	At least the end
	Of sorrow
	Though tomorrow
	Never comes
	And yesterday  
	Never even was
	
	Bridge One
	So sometimes 
	sing it softly
	Sometimes
	Sing it loud
	Sometimes
	By your lonesome
	sometimes
	In a crowd
	
	Bridge Two
	So some would
	Fall to pieces
	Some would
	Fall apart
	Some would
	Take your body
	Some would
	Break your heart
	
	Chorus
	The horizons
	just a wall
	That has fallen
	And I’m sorry 
	You got trapped
	On this plane
	Some other 
	Timeline has it all
	And its calling
	Your name
	And you wouldn’t 
	Be to blame 
	If you left us
09:28:59 From Maggie Barth to Everyone:
	If
	belonging
	is subjective, a sense or feeling and
	is based on being known and
	is crucial to the sense of community which in turn
	is critical to the connectedness of community
	
	Then
	aren’t inquiry
	creating space and 
	learning
	(about and for ourselves and others)
	essential skills to develop?

	Now, to create that vocation.
09:29:00 From John Mark Padillo to Everyone:
	Pressing the submit button seems to get easier over time. Growing up shy, introverted and socially awkward has had its ties with the inability to freely and safely express myself. There goes the saying in many abusive relationships of “not having a voice.” I can only imagine the breakthrough moments when one begins to slowly share their voice to the world and being received by it. What would that be like? Would it not be like climbing the highest mountains and screaming with everything you’ve got? Just imagining that makes me want to scream right now.
